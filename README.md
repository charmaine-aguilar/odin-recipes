# The Odin Project: Odin Recipes with HTML and CSS
Tech used: `HTML`, `CSS`

## Overview
This is the first project from The Odin Project that showcases applications of HTML and CSS fundamentals. The website shows 3 recipes made with recipe cards, and each of these recipes can be clicked to view details about it. Simple navigations to the next recipe and going back to main are added inside each recipe. I have tried my best to write the HTML with semantics to practice accessibility.
