            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A sizzling combo of the highest quality bacon and eggs, complete with a no mess cooking experience because your magical fire friend is eco-friendly and eats food waste instead.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2~6 pieces of top quality bacon (depending on how many you're gonna share with)</li>
                <li>2~6 eggs</li>
                <li>2 tbsp of cooking oil</li>
                <li>Bread (optional)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pre-heat your pan with your stove in medium and put the cooking oil in it.</li>
                <li>Fry your eggs, making sure they're a little crispy on the sides but the yolk remains runny and carefully sprinkle a bit of salt on the yolk to taste.</li>
                <li>Set aside your eggs and fry your bacons. Carefully gauge the heat of your pan not to burn your bacon to a crisp.</li>
                <li>Heat your bread</li>
                <li>Plate everything and serve with a side of hot coffee!</li>
            </ol>
